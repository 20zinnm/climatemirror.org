			<h2>Mirrors</h2>
			<p>Climate Mirror is a distributed effort conducted by volunteers, in conjunction with efforts from institurions such as University of Pennsylvania, University of Toronto, and the Internet Archive.</p>
			<p>The following sites are known to host mirrors of climate data:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://climate.daknob.net">climate.daknob.net</a> - includes a list of known mirrored datasets from volunteers</li>
					<li><a href="http://climatetorrents.com">climatetorrents.com</a></li>
					<li><a href="ftp://paleo.climatemirror.org">paleo.climatemirror.org</a></li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Partners</h2>
			<p>The volunteers on this project are working in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge">PPEH Lab at the University of Pennsylvania</a> which runs the #DataReuge project. The team there includes professional archivists and researchers, who are organizing efforts and working with the volunteers to standardize our approach to making backups and live mirrors.</p>
			<p>We are also aware of and working in coordination with more established players in government data archiving, such as the Internet Archive and California Digital Library's <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2016/12/15/preserving-u-s-government-websites-and-data-as-the-obama-term-ends/">End of Term Project</a>.</p>

			<h2>About This Site</h2>
			<p>Climate Mirror is part of an ad-hoc project to mirror public climate datasets <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/scientists-are-frantically-copying-u-s-climate-data-fearing-it-might-vanish-under-trump/?utm_term=.fde03c8c8d0c">before the Trump Administration takes office</a> to make sure these datasets remain freely and broadly accessible. It was kicked off by <a href="https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/807802801506041856">a tweet from journalist Eric Holthaus</a>, and similar efforts were started independently at the University of Toronto and University of Pennsylvania.</p>
